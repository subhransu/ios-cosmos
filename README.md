## Idea behind iOS Cosmos

Few months ago, a friend of mine asked me if there is a single place where he can find everything he needs to know about iOS development. He was looking for something that will help him get started not only with iOS development APIs or frameworks but also find out what it takes to build a complete product. 

He was interested to find out what are our choice of tools for Contineous Integration and what do we use to distribute our apps to beta testers, what are the security guidelines the community recommends. 

Having worked as an iOS developer for several years I knew there isn't any such site or resource. The resources are often distributed accross official Apple documentation, tons of tutorial sites, blogs, podcasts, books, newsletters, tweets from renowned iOS developers and what not. 

And there is also [awesome-ios](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios) by [Vinicius Souza](https://github.com/vsouza). So I don't want to recreate it. 

However, I definitely see something is missing in all of the above resources. A community driven single point reference. I hope **iOS Cosmos** helps to solve this.
